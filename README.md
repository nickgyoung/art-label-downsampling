# Using Principal Component Analysis to Save Space on my Phone

### About

This is a repo of the technical files supporting a small data project I made that used OpenAI's CLIP model, PyTesseract, and Principal Component Analysis to differentiate between pictures of art and pictures of text, apply grayscale, crop to text, and downsample by use of PCA.

The project was motivated from my decreasing available phone storage, knowledge of a good solution I could use to create a bit of space, and a desire to try some new solutions whilst explaining how these work as a portfolio project.

Through the notebooks provided, I downsampled a corpus of images from 1.6gb to 1.2gb, roughly 25% reduction in size.

### Dependencies

Adhering to file/repo size recommendations, I will not be including my full corpus of images, but instead a small sample of 24 photos across 3 folders so that this could be reproduced on a small scale if desired. Packages used are recorded in `requirements.txt` and the Python version used is 3.10.11
